Yeah, GitHub has a hard file size limit of 100 MB, so anything above that won’t push unless you use Git LFS (or another method). Here are your options:

⚠️ TL;DR:
Since .pth is 102 MB, you can't push it to GitHub directly, but here’s what you can do:

✅ Option 1: Compress the .pth File (Good if you're just slightly over)
Try compressing the .pth file using gzip or zip. PyTorch .pth files are often compressible:

bash
Copy code
gzip your_model.pth  # creates your_model.pth.gz
You’ll likely get under the 100 MB limit (depends on model structure), and you can then upload it like a regular file.

In Python, you can load a gzipped model like this:

python
Copy code
import gzip
import torch

with gzip.open('your_model.pth.gz', 'rb') as f:
    model.load_state_dict(torch.load(f))
✅ Option 2: Use a File Hosting Service
If compression doesn’t help or if you're working with larger files, upload the file elsewhere:

Google Drive

Dropbox

OneDrive

Hugging Face Hub

Zenodo (for academic usage)

S3 or another cloud bucket

And then include a download script in your repo, e.g., download_model.py, that fetches the file.

✅ Option 3: Split the File (Not ideal but works)
Split the file into chunks below 100MB using split:

bash
Copy code
split -b 90M your_model.pth model_chunk_
Then push all chunks to GitHub. In your script, you’d merge them back:

bash
Copy code
cat model_chunk_* > your_model.pth
Make sure to .gitignore the full .pth file to avoid confusion.

✅ Option 4: Fix LFS if you really want to go that route
If you want to use Git LFS but are running into issues, I can help debug that too—just let me know what errors you're getting.

Let me know which route you're leaning toward, and I can give you detailed steps or scripts for it.
